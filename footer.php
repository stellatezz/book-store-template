    <h3>THE BOOKSTORE</h3>
    <p><em>designed by group A1</em></p>
    <p>We planned to design an information system for a large-scale book store
      with multiple branch in different regions. Therefore, an online system is
      needed so that the manager and staff can update the data to the system simultaneously.
      Also, the customers can check their information of the membership and find their favorite
      books via this online system, so it is more convenient to the customers to buy a book. Therefore,
      we need to set up a system that include all information about the book store. </p>
